# Fake data hub
Fake Data Hub is an open project for creating real looking data sets and schemas generated based on desired statistics. All code made in R!

# Preface
In the modern world, we have various powerful tools to analyze data. Many of them promise a lot of advanced functionality for automatic insights, data mining, and ML. A problem comes with data:  while tools do claim that they are capable to find insights in data, real-world data does not obligatory contain these insights.  There are a lot of reasons for that: either we have not enough data or the data we have does not represent the population or phenomenon we are looking for, or life appear to work not the way we expected:)

To overcome this issue I decided to start a little project - Fake Data Hub. The idea is as simple as that: to get something out of the data you first need to put something in! The ultimate goal is to be able to generate any reasonable amount of fake data that looks almost like real and statistically shaped according to our needs.
